The aim of this project is to measure the performance of GPS navigation using a
breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm implemented using the CUDA parallel computing
platform. The BFS algorithm is one of the well-known graph traversal techniques that is
widely used in various applications, including navigation systems. By implementing the
algorithm using CUDA, we can accelerate execution speeds by utilizing the parallel
processing capacity of contemporary GPUs.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the GPS navigation algorithm, we will use a set of
test cases with different input sizes and complexity levels. We will analyze the algorithm's
runtime and memory requirements of the algorithm using different hardware
configurations, including CPU and the GPU systems. The output result will be compared
to identify the potential benefits of using CUDA for GPS navigation.
The project will involve developing and testing the CUDA implementation of the
BFS algorithm, designing and executing experiments to collect performance data, and
analyzing the results using statistical techniques. The outcomes of this project will
contribute to the understanding of the performance characteristics of GPS navigation using
BFS and provide insights into the potential benefits of using parallel computing platforms
like CUDA for real-time navigation systems.
